## PART 1: Process Monitoring using `top`

### Scenario
An administrator needs to monitor system performance and running processes.

### Tasks

1. Display all running processes using a process monitoring tool.
2. Identify the process with the highest CPU usage.
3. Identify the process with the highest memory usage.
4. Observe the PID, USER, CPU%, and MEM% columns.
5. Sort processes based on CPU usage.
6. Sort processes based on memory usage.
7. Identify system load average values.
8. Exit the process monitoring screen.
9. Reopen the monitoring tool and verify changes.
10. Record observations.

## PART 2: Process Priority and Nice Value

### Scenario
Some processes should run with **lower priority** so they do not affect system performance.

### Tasks

11. Create a process that runs for a long time.
12. Check the default nice value of the process.
13. Start a process with a custom nice value.
14. Verify the nice value of the newly started process.
15. Identify the difference between default and custom nice values.
16. Change the nice value of a running process.
17. Verify the updated priority.
18. Observe how priority affects CPU usage.
19. Record observations.
20. Exit the process safely.

## PART 3: Renicing a Running Process

### Scenario
A running process is consuming excessive CPU and needs priority adjustment.

### Tasks

21. Identify the PID of a running process.
22. Check the current nice value of the process.
23. Change the nice value of the running process.
24. Verify the updated nice value.
25. Observe system behavior after priority change.

## PART 4: Process Termination using `kill`

### Scenario
A process becomes unresponsive and must be terminated.

### Tasks

26. Identify a running process to terminate.
27. Terminate the process using a normal signal.
28. Verify that the process has stopped.
29. Start another long-running process.
30. Terminate the process using a forceful signal.
31. Verify process termination.
32. Observe the difference between normal and forceful termination.
